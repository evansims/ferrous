# Test Evaluation Report

## Current State Analysis

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Located within source files (`#[cfg(test)]` modules)
  - `src/database/implementations/in_memory.rs`: Database implementation tests
  - `src/config.rs`: Configuration validation tests
  - `src/version.rs`: Version parsing tests

- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/` directory
  - `tests/integration/`: Domain-separated integration tests
  - `tests/config_tests.rs`: Configuration integration tests
  - `tests/metrics_tests.rs`: Metrics endpoint tests
  - `tests/version_tests.rs`: API versioning tests

### Issues Identified

1. **Test Organization**
   - Integration tests are partially organized by domain but inconsistent
   - Some tests in root `tests/` should be in `tests/integration/`
   - Missing clear separation between unit and integration tests

2. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - No unit tests for: error handling, middleware, handlers, routing
   - Missing edge cases for authentication and rate limiting
   - No tests for database connection failures
   - Missing tests for concurrent operations

3. **Best Practices Violations**
   - Test names don't always follow `should_` or `when_then_` convention
   - Some tests test multiple behaviors (violates single responsibility)
   - Insufficient use of test fixtures and builders
   - Missing documentation for complex test scenarios

## Recommended Structure

### Unit Tests (in `src/`)
Each module should have its own unit tests testing internal logic:
- Pure functions
- Internal state management
- Edge cases and error conditions
- No external dependencies

### Integration Tests (in `tests/integration/`)
Organized by domain:
```
tests/integration/
├── items/           # Item CRUD operations
├── auth/            # Authentication flows
├── rate_limiting/   # Rate limit behavior
├── metrics/         # Metrics collection
├── health/          # Health checks
├── errors/          # Error handling
└── middleware/      # Middleware behavior
```

## Action Plan

1. Reorganize existing tests by domain
2. Add missing unit tests for core modules
3. Implement test builders and fixtures
4. Add concurrent operation tests
5. Document test scenarios
